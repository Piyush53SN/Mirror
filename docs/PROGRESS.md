# Mirror — progress and approved decisions

Living document. **Approved decisions are not re-litigated**; if a later phase
contradicts one, the phase report has to say so explicitly.

Source of requirements: `docs/SPEC.md` (Section J is the 28-item inventory).

## Phase status

| phase | state | what shipped |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P-UI-0 | **approved** | image analysis → design brief (`docs/design/00-image-analysis.md`), measurements (`docs/design/measurements.md`), reference copy + analyzer |
| P-UI-1 | **accepted** | generated tokens (`packages/ui/tokens/`), single-file phone prototype (`prototype/index.html`) — commit `93e83cc` |
| P-UI-2 | **in review** | React Native design system (`packages/ui/src`), all 28 Section J items (`packages/ui/screens`), mockup gallery (`packages/ui/mockups/gallery`), **86** tests |
| P0…P7 | not started | — |

## Approved decisions

### Process

- **Phase output** is always the 8-part report (plan, file tree, code, tests, run
  instructions, limitations, release impact with AUTOMATED/MANUAL labels, and a
  question only if blocking), then **stop for approval**.
- **Never claim a pipeline, deploy or store step works unless it is scripted and
  verified.** Every deployment step is labelled AUTOMATED or MANUAL.
- **Measured beats assumed.** Where a measurement disagrees with an earlier
  assumption or with the draft spec's example values, the measured value ships
  and the disagreement is recorded.
- **Section J is 28 items, verbatim from the brief** (`docs/SPEC.md` §6). The
  18-item list delivered earlier in P-UI-2 was my derivation and has been
  **replaced**. Every item — screens, sheets, states and widgets — must appear in
  the gallery and be covered by tests.
- **The design brief stays frozen.** The measured `title-lg 22/28` type step ships
  as a **token delta** (`packages/ui/tokens/image-tokens.json`), and the brief is
  not edited to absorb it.
- **Mockups live in `packages/ui/mockups/gallery/`** (committed). They are
  rendered from the real components through a DOM binding of `react-native`, so a
  token change changes the picture and no second styling path exists.
- **A sheet or a state is never rendered as a page.** The Why drawer, the Ask
  sheet, the Privacy Receipt, the persona picker, the share card and the update
  notice are drawn *over* the screen they belong to, and the gallery marks which
  screen that is.

### Design, measured from the reference image

- Colour is **achromatic** (mean OKLab chroma 0.00011); 13 measured tokens; no
  accent colour, no grain, no vignette.
- **Dark is the default** theme and is derived from the same image, not inverted:
  dark mirrors OKLab L and re-spreads the elevation ladder over L\* 4→33 to
  escape the sRGB dead zone. `"dark = 1 − light"` was measured and rejected.
- **Glass:** shell α ≈ 0.32 light / 0.087 dark with a 1 px `rgba(255,255,255,…)`
  hairline; blurred-photo backdrop ≈ 40–60 px equivalent. **Live blur is limited
  to the tab bar and the sheets — 2 of a budget of 3 layers.** Shell, cards,
  chips, segmented controls and icon buttons use pre-composited fills.
- **Radii:** measured shell 28 (rms 0.9), hero 20, month-progress 20, dock 18;
  shipped xs 6 · sm 10 · md 14 · dock 18 · card 20 · hero 24 · sheet 28 ·
  pill 999 · phone 40.
- **Type: Inter** (best fit 0.618). display 34/40 w700 −0.02em · headline 26/32
  w700 · title-lg 22/28 w700 −0.015em · title 17/22 w600 · body 15/21 w500 ·
  label 13/17 w500 · micro 11/14 w600 +0.06em; every size
  `calc(Npx * var(--m-text-scale))`.
- **Contrast:** 14 audited pairs, all ≥ 4.5:1, with 4 automatic adjustments
  logged. The reference itself fails AA in one place
  (`mutedOnGraphite` 3.27:1) — that is recorded, not copied.
- **48 dp** everywhere on the phone, including sub-48 elements padded to a 48 dp
  hit area; verified by measurement, in the test suite and by the prototype's own
  checker.

### Product rules encoded in the design system

- Data tiers **A/B/C/D** with `degrade()`: a feature that cannot be computed says
  *"<feature> is unavailable: it needs tier X data, which is not on this device.
  Mirror will not estimate it."* and names how the user could change that.
- **Typed feature flags**: anything that leaves the device, and social features,
  are `owner: 'user'`, `defaultOn: false`. Flags can never enable collection.
  `auditFlagPosture()` fails the build if a user-owned flag defaults on, or if a
  default-on flag has no empty state.
- **Boundary toggle** states the consequence in both directions (Private /
  Public). DIP and PIP never appear in UI copy.
- No streaks, no guilt copy, no engagement notifications; an empty state offers at
  most one action and never a nudge.

## Known limitations carried forward

- **No browser in the build sandbox.** `npm run check:prototype` exits **2 —
  "nothing measured", never a pass**. The browser gate exists and is scripted; it
  needs a machine with a browser (or CI with one).
- **No device or emulator run yet.** The design system renders through a DOM
  binding; structure, sizing logic and tone are verified, pixels and gestures are
  not. Device verification needs the app shell (P0).
- **Inter is not bundled** as a webfont, so the mockups fall back to
  `system-ui`; the metrics in the tokens are Inter's.
- Text measurement in the repo's DOM stub is character-count based, so widths in
  48 dp reports are approximate; heights and explicit sizes are exact.
- No i18n/RTL pass yet.

## Open questions

- None blocking. (The earlier `title-lg` question is answered: brief frozen, token
  delta ships — see above.)
